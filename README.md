# Engulfing-trading-bot
This repo includes a personal project about the engulfing candle trading strategy. The project entails reading the price range of a stock or crypto, in this case BTC, in a desired range of time, creating a table and graph and sending buy or sell signals depending on what the trading bot returns.
